# Implementation Progress

This document tracks the progress of the MCP Client UI implementation.

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Architecture

- [x] Initialize Vite project with React and TypeScript template
- [x] Install key dependencies (axios, monaco-editor, styled-components)
- [x] Create basic project directory structure
- [x] Configure TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier
- [x] Define MCP schema type definitions
- [x] Create initial component architecture
- [x] Set up React Context for state management

## Phase 2: API Integration Layer

- [x] Create ApiClient class with Axios instance
- [x] Implement authentication interceptors
- [x] Create WebSocketClient for streaming endpoints
- [x] Define TypeScript interfaces for all request/response types
- [x] Add connection status monitoring
- [x] Create API hooks for common operations

## Phase 3: Terminal Interface Core Components

- [x] Implement TerminalContainer component
- [x] Create CommandInput with Monaco editor integration
- [x] Develop ResponseDisplay with syntax highlighting
- [x] Build StreamDisplay for WebSocket responses
- [x] Implement command history navigation
- [x] Add command parsing and validation

## Phase 4: Command Parser & Executor

- [x] Create command parser to detect command type and parameters
- [x] Implement validation against function schemas
- [x] Build command executor routing to appropriate endpoints
- [x] Add special terminal commands (clear, history, help)
- [x] Implement error handling and validation feedback

## Phase 5: Protocol Visualization

- [x] Create request/response flow visualization
- [x] Implement timing indicators for requests
- [ ] Add visual representation of protocol steps
- [ ] Build expandable JSON inspector for requests/responses
- [ ] Create schema visualization for function parameters

## Phase 6: Enhanced Features

- [ ] Implement multi-tab interface for parallel testing
- [ ] Add favorites system for common commands
- [ ] Create export/import functionality
- [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Add command builder UI for complex parameters

## Phase 7: Testing, Documentation & Refinement

- [ ] Set up testing framework
- [ ] Test all endpoints with actual MCP server
- [ ] Create usage examples and tutorials
- [ ] Add inline help and tooltips
- [ ] Optimize performance for large responses

## Current Focus

Currently working on Phase 5: Protocol Visualization - Adding visual representation of protocol steps and building an expandable JSON inspector for requests/responses.
