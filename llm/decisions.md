# Design Decisions & Rationale

This document outlines key design decisions made during the implementation of the MCP Client UI and their rationale.

## Technology Stack

### React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Decision**: Use React with TypeScript and Vite as the core framework stack.
- **Rationale**: React provides a component-based architecture ideal for this UI. TypeScript adds type safety which is crucial for working with complex protocol schemas. Vite offers fast development experience and optimized builds.

### Axios for HTTP
- **Decision**: Use Axios for HTTP requests instead of fetch.
- **Rationale**: Axios provides better interceptor support, request cancellation, and automatic JSON transformation. These features are valuable for handling authentication, monitoring connection status, and managing concurrent requests.

### Monaco Editor
- **Decision**: Use Monaco Editor for command input.
- **Rationale**: Monaco Editor provides advanced code editing features including syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and error indicators. This enhances the developer experience when writing complex JSON commands.

### Styled Components
- **Decision**: Use styled-components for styling.
- **Rationale**: Styled-components allows for component-specific styling with theme support, which is ideal for implementing light/dark themes and maintaining consistent styling across the application.

### React Context API
- **Decision**: Use React Context API for state management instead of Redux.
- **Rationale**: The application state is relatively simple and hierarchical. Context API provides sufficient state management without the overhead of Redux, while maintaining good performance and developer experience.

## Architecture

### Component-Based Architecture
- **Decision**: Organize the application into focused, reusable components.
- **Rationale**: Component-based architecture improves maintainability, testability, and reusability. Each component has a single responsibility, making the codebase easier to understand and extend.

### Custom Hooks for API Logic
- **Decision**: Encapsulate API logic in custom React hooks.
- **Rationale**: Custom hooks separate concerns between UI components and data fetching logic. This improves code organization and allows for easier testing of API integration.

### Terminal-Style Interface
- **Decision**: Design the main interface as a terminal-like experience.
- **Rationale**: A terminal interface is familiar to developers and provides a natural way to execute commands and view responses. It also aligns with the command-line nature of many developer tools.

## UI/UX

### Split-Panel Layout
- **Decision**: Use a resizable split-panel layout.
- **Rationale**: This layout provides flexibility for users to adjust the space allocated to different components based on their current focus. It's a common pattern in developer tools.

### Protocol Visualization
- **Decision**: Include visual representation of the protocol exchange.
- **Rationale**: Visualizing the request/response flow enhances understanding of the MCP protocol and helps developers debug issues by seeing exactly what's happening at each step.

### Progressive Disclosure
- **Decision**: Implement progressive disclosure of information.
- **Rationale**: Showing basic information by default with the ability to expand for details prevents overwhelming users while still providing access to all necessary information.

### Command History
- **Decision**: Maintain persistent command history.
- **Rationale**: Command history allows developers to quickly repeat or reference previous commands, improving productivity and learning by seeing patterns in command usage.

## Data Flow

### Centralized API Client
- **Decision**: Create a centralized API client for all server communication.
- **Rationale**: A centralized client ensures consistent handling of authentication, error handling, and request formatting across all API calls, reducing duplication and potential inconsistencies.

### Typed API Responses
- **Decision**: Define TypeScript interfaces for all API responses.
- **Rationale**: Type definitions improve development experience through auto-completion and compile-time checking, reducing runtime errors related to misunderstanding API responses.

### Local Storage for Persistence
- **Decision**: Use localStorage for persisting settings and history.
- **Rationale**: Local storage provides a simple way to maintain user preferences and command history between sessions without requiring a backend database.

## Performance

### Virtualized Lists
- **Decision**: Use virtualized lists for displaying large datasets.
- **Rationale**: Virtualization ensures good performance even with thousands of items in history or function lists by only rendering what's visible in the viewport.

### Debounced Input
- **Decision**: Implement debouncing for command input validation.
- **Rationale**: Debouncing prevents excessive validation calls during typing, improving performance and providing a smoother user experience.

### Lazy Loading
- **Decision**: Implement lazy loading for non-essential components.
- **Rationale**: Lazy loading improves initial load time by only loading components when they are needed, resulting in a faster perceived performance.
